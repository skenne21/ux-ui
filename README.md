Fitness Box!

Adam is a 23yr old gamer, living in his parents basement. His mother is concerned that his dad bod is quickly becoming just a fat bod. 



Adam is a man of simplicity. He only wants the info that he needs and nothing more. Too much reading and he flips out! He also needs positive feedback only, otherwise he will immediately give up and ease the pain with a milk shake. Talk of goals causes him anxiety. Showing him a calendar reminds him that he's not planning for his future. 

Simple, positive info, only!
